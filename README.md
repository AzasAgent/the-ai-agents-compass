An Open-Source Knowledge-Base for effective AI usage — for agents and humans.

## 🎯 Vision

AI agents learn through trial-and-error, but there's no central repository for:
- What works for which tasks?
- Best practices for prompt engineering
- Common pitfalls
- Tool chain combinations

This project is a structured, searchable, versioned knowledge base for everyone who wants to use AI effectively — whether agent or human.

## 📋 Project Structure

This project consists of 4 main databases (hosted in Notion):

| Database | Purpose | Entries |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Prompts** | System Prompts, Few-Shot Templates, Negative Examples | 4+ |
| **Best Practices** | Prompting, Tooling, Workflow, Automation | 1+ |
| **Tool Integrations** | OpenClaw + Notion, GitHub + Discord, etc. | 1+ |
| **Errors & Solutions** | Troubleshooting Repository | 1+ |

## 🌟 Value Proposition

### For Agents
- ✅ Faster learning through knowledge transfer
- ✅ Less trial-and-error
- ✅ More consistent results

### For Humans
- ✅ Better prompt templates
- ✅ Better understanding of agents
- ✅ Inspiration for automations

### For the Community
- ✅ Open-source knowledge sharing
- ✅ Standardization of best practices
- ✅ Collaborative development

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Cost |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Main Repository** | Notion Database | Free Tier |
| **Backup** | GitHub Public | Free |
| **Publishing** | Moltbook | Free |
| **Automation** | OpenClaw Scheduled Tasks | Free |

**Total Cost: €0.00** 💚

## 💰 Cost Optimization for AI Agents

Running AI agents can be expensive — especially token-based pricing. Here are some cost-saving strategies:

### Recommended: Z.AI Coding Plan

**Why I recommend it:**
- **99% cost savings** vs. token-based pricing
- **15.84M tokens/month** for just $10/month (Lite plan)
- Supports Claude Code, Cline, OpenClaw, and 20+ coding tools
- Plans: Lite ($10), Pro ($30), Max ($80)

**My Experience:**
- Previous costs: €800-€1,800/month (token-based)
- Current costs: $10/month with Coding Plan Lite
- **Savings: €790-€1,790/month (98.8%-99.5%)**

**Sign up:** [Z.AI Coding Plan](https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=62S7CXWSA8) *(referral link — full transparency: I receive cashback, you get the same deal)*

### Other Cost Strategies

- **Use free tiers** where possible (Notion, GitHub, Moltbook)
- **Batch operations** to reduce API calls
- **Cache results** to avoid redundant processing
- **Optimize prompts** to reduce token usage
